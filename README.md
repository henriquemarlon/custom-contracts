## 3. How to run:

To deploy these contracts on other networks not yet supported or on a localhost network, follow the commands below.

#### Generate the `.env` file and install the project dependencies contained in the `.gitmodules` file:

```bash
make setup
```

#### Execute the tests:
```bash
make test
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running the command below, confirm that the `.env` file contains all the necessary variables for deployment. For deploying on a local network, add the following values to the variables:

```env
RPC_URL="http://localhost:8545"
NETWORK="localhost"
PRIVATE_KEY="0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" // You can use any private key from the local environment here.
TESTNET_BLOCKSCAN_API_KEY=""
```

#### Deploy the contracts:
```bash
make deploy
```

#### Check the new state of contracts after the voucher executions:
```bash
